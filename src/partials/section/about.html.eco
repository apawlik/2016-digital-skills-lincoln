<p itemprop="description">This event provides an opportunity for all researchers to improve their computational lab skills through a number of hands-on training sessions. Training modules are offered by experienced researchers who are keen to share their knowledge and skills with members of their research communities.</p>

<p> Digital Skills for Research Training Week @ Lincoln is organised by several New Zealand research institutions:
<a href="http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/">Landcare Research</a>,
<a href="http://www.agresearch.co.nz/">AgResearch</a>,
<a href="http://www.plantandfood.co.nz/">Plant & Food Research</a>,
<a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/">Lincoln University</a>
 and <a href="http://www.nesi.org.nz/">New Zealand eScience Infrastructure</a>. </p>

<p> This event consists of two parts. The first one is the Software Carpentry workshop which will take place 17-18th October, 2016. This hands-on workshop takes full two days (see details below). The second part of this training event is an array of shorter training modules which are more domain-specific (please see the schedule below). You are welcome to sign up for any sessions you find useful. You can choose to attend only Software Carpentry workshop or only some of the sessions taking place between 19th and 21st October. However, please note that if you want to attend Software Carpentry workshop, we advise that you come for the full two days (Monday and Tuesday). </p>
